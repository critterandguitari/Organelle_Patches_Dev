These 2 Organelle patches demonstrate how 2 patches may use the same sound samples.  For this to work the 'Sounds' folder must be placed on the USB drive root, next to the Patches folder.  Then 'Sampler Recorder' and 'Sampler Sequencer' go into the Patches folder.   So it looks like this

USB/Sounds/
USB/Patches/Sampler Recorder
USB/Patches/Sampler Sequencer

Sampler Recorder allows you to record sounds by pressing the Aux button on the Organelle.  They are saved automatically in the Sounds folder.   Then you can fire up Sampler Sequencer which loads these same sounds and allows you to make sequences with them.
